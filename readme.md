USGS Names Map Interface
========================
A web interface for querying a MYSQL database of USGS names with results to be displayed via the Leaflet javascript library.

The data is from [https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data].

The goal is to brush up on a few different skills:
- SQL (MYSQL used for actual project and SQLite used for local experiment/exploration of data)
- web dev tools: HTML, PHP, JavaScript
- git
- Emacs (lol)
- hadn't used the Leaflet JavaScript library before but it will be helpful for future projects
